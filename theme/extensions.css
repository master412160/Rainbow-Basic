*      Style: Rainbow Basic (free)
*      
*      -----------------GENERAL DISCLAIMER---------------------------------
*      This Style like mentioned below is use at your own risk. 
*      I take no responsibilty for the usage of Rainbow Basic.
*      As such this theme is given to you for free.
*      So use Rainbow Basic at your own risk.
*                            
*      I try my best to make my themes secure, up to standards and html5 valid with no errors.
*      Still my theme can have the best code in the world and your forum can still get hacked.
*      Having an insecure password is one way a hacker can get into your forum.
*      Or having an outdated phpBB extension with an SQL vurnability can cause your forum to get hacked.
*      Best you can do is always download the latest version of phpBB, 
*      this theme and extensions or any other resources you may use like TapaTalk.
