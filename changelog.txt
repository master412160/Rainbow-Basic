****/-->
This is to keep track of build versions and release versions of Rainbow Basic and what has been done to it. :) 

current release version: 
Current build: 
Last Commit: 
/////////////////////////
Version system explained:

first number is the release version, when a series of builds has been completed; we'll summarize that in a release. eg: version 1.0, version 2.0. 
This is changed when major feature or design changes are added or a series of builds (7)* is complete. 

second number changes when a series of changes has been done worth noting down in here. So a work log is created in due time. 
When at least 7 worthwhile things have been added/removed the build number goes up.

third number changes when a commit is done to the rainbow repository which is private at the moment. 
(( Watch this space for more info in the future about the repo! ))

-------
* When 7 builds are done a new release is put in motion. A release is the theme being put online to be used by the end user.
This changelog has just been started in March so allot of changes that happened before for the rainbow theme are not covered here.
